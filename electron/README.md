# Desktop (macOS) wrapper

This folder contains a minimal Electron wrapper that loads the production web app:

- https://yohand-byte.github.io/huawei-sales-margin-tracker/

Why: macOS will list **Huawei Sales Manager** as an app for Notifications (instead of "Google Chrome"),
once the app sends/receives notifications.
